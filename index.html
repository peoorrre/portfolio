<h2>Application of Skills</h2>
<p>
My skills have been applied in various projects, demonstrating my proficiency in different
areas. As in my Payroll work it shows my effort and my understanding how to use excel and
shows how to operate different ways in making lists and grading them in different sections.
While in my instapaper, although i did it with 3 other individuals i still learnt how to make
presentations and also learnt how to properly market my ideas.
</p>
<p>
I also learnt how to use google docs and most obvious how to make a website as i am currently
doing right now. I also used apps like WIX which also opened my mind more on how websites
are really created and how things are really done in the outside world.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Reflecting on my journey, I am proud of the progress I have made and the skills I have
acquired. Although at the start of my journey in business and technology it was quite difficult but
through the help of my teacher and from taking time to be able to understand my work better i
was able to learn different skills in this class and learn how to make websites, design
presentations, understand computers (software and hardware) and most importantly the ability
to be able to make a formal letter as i believe that would really help me in the future.
